To fix this issue, ensure that the parent element has a defined width.  You can do this by setting a specific width or by using a width relative to its parent element.  Here's an example:

```css
.container {
  width: 80%; /* Or a fixed width like 800px */
}

div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  /* Other styles */
}
```

By setting the width of the `.container`, you are providing the `calc()` function with the necessary information it needs to correctly calculate the width of the `div` element.  If you cannot set a width on the direct parent, you may need to traverse up the DOM tree and set a width higher up.
