# CSS calc() function issue with undefined parent width

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the `calc()` function in CSS when the parent element's width is undefined.  Some browsers may not handle this correctly, leading to unexpected rendering behavior.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to the problem.

This is a good demonstration of how to approach unexpected CSS behavior and how a thorough understanding of CSS specifications can aid in debugging.
