The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  /* Other styles */
}
```

The `calc()` function is used to calculate the width of the div element. However, if the parent element does not have a defined width, the calculation may not work as expected. In some browsers, this can lead to the div element not being rendered correctly, or having an incorrect width.
